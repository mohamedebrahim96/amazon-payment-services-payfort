**Mobile App SDK Features**.   
Native in-app payment. In the past, customers that made a purchase in your app would be redirected to a mobile browsing session to complete payment. It is an inconvenient experience for customers, and customers can lose trust, abandoning the purchase. Instead, the mobile app SDK ensures that your customer completes the entire transaction in-app.

Fully secure. Your customers enjoy the same, trusted Amazon Payment Services experience in-app when you make use of the mobile app SDK. Card details are transmitted across a fully secure layer and authentication is securely handled by Amazon Payment Services.

Fully customized. The Amazon Payment Services mobile SDK is fully customizable, giving your customers a native experience on both Android and iOS devices.
